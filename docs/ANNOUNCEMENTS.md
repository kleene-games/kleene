Kleene - Text Adventures That Actually Adapt

Unlike traditional choice-based games, Kleene responds to free-form actions and improvisation. The temperature system lets you control how much the AI adapts - from traditional branching (temp 0) to fully emergent storytelling (temp 10).

FEATURES:
• True Improvisation - Type anything, not just pick from options
• Temperature System - Same scenario, infinite variations
• 4 Scenarios Included - Fantasy, thriller, surreal mystery, corporate drama
• Easy Creation - Simple YAML format, no coding required
• Built-in Tools - Generator, validator, analyzer

QUICK START:
/kleene play          # Start playing
/kleene generate      # Create your own
/kleene temperature 5 # Set adaptation level

Perfect for players who want agency and creators who want to share stories.

Made specifically for Claude Code. Open source (AGPL-3.0).

## Claude Code Community Post

### Launch Announcement

```markdown
# 🎮 Introducing Kleene - Adaptive Text Adventures for Claude Code

I'm excited to share Kleene, an adaptive AI text adventure engine built specifically for Claude Code!

## What Makes It Different?

**True Improvisation**
Not just multiple choice - type anything and the AI responds:
- "I examine the dragon's scales for weak points"
- "I try to befriend the guard"
- "I search for hidden passages"

**The Temperature System (The Magic Sauce)**
Same scenario, completely different experience:
- Temp 0: Traditional branching (like a classic choose-your-own-adventure)
- Temp 10: Fully emergent storytelling (the AI adapts everything)

Try Dragon Quest at temp 0, then replay at temp 10. It's the same scenario file, but feels like a completely different game.

## Quick Demo

Here's what happened when I played The Yabba at temp 10:

[Insert gameplay snippet showing improvised action and AI response]

The scenario didn't explicitly script this moment - the AI adapted based on my exploration. That's Kleene's magic.

## Four Scenarios Included

- **Dragon Quest** (beginner) - 15-20 min
- **The Yabba** (advanced) - 30-60 min - Psychological thriller
- **Altered State Nightclub** (experimental) - 20-40 min
- **Corporate Banking** (intermediate) - 25-35 min

## Create Your Own

Simple YAML format, no coding required:

\`\`\`bash
/kleene generate a haunted mansion mystery
\`\`\`

Or use the templates and guides in the repo.

## Try It Now

\`\`\`bash
/kleene play
\`\`\`

Start with Dragon Quest at temp 0, then experiment!

Title: [Project] Kleene - Adaptive AI Text Adventures with Temperature Control

I've been working on an adaptive text adventure engine for Claude Code that uses a "temperature" system to control narrative adaptation.

The concept: same scenario file, but at temp 0 it plays like traditional branching IF, while at temp 10 it becomes fully emergent with AI-adapted storytelling.

Key features:
- Free-text improvisation (not just multiple choice)
- Temperature system (0-10 controls adaptation)
- Simple YAML authoring (no coding)
- 4 bundled scenarios
- Open source (AGPL-3.0)

Example: You type "I examine the dragon's scales for weak points" and the AI generates a contextual response. At higher temps, this discovery gets woven into the narrative.

Would love feedback from the IF community! Especially interested in hearing from creators.

### Email Body

```
Hi [Name],

I'm excited to share Kleene, an adaptive AI text adventure engine I built for Claude Code.

THE PROBLEM WITH TRADITIONAL TEXT ADVENTURES:

Your "choices" often feel fake. Pick option A or B, but they lead to the same outcome with different flavor text. You can't improvise. You can't explore. You're stuck on rails.

KLEENE'S SOLUTION:

Temperature control. Same scenario, infinite variations:

• Temp 0: Traditional branching (for first playthrough)
• Temp 5: Balanced adaptation
• Temp 10: Fully emergent storytelling

PLUS: True improvisation. Type anything - "I examine the dragon's scales" or "I try to befriend the guard" - and the AI responds.

TRY IT NOW:

Four scenarios included:
- Dragon Quest (15 min, beginner)
- The Yabba (60 min, psychological thriller)
- Altered State Nightclub (40 min, surreal)
- Corporate Banking (35 min, career drama)

Just run: /kleene play

CREATE YOUR OWN:

Simple YAML format. No coding. Built-in generator and validator.

Templates and guides included.

IT'S FREE AND OPEN SOURCE:

AGPL-3.0. Use it, share it, create with it - all derivatives stay open.

[Get Started] [Read Docs] [See Examples]

Would love to hear what you create!

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - The temperature system is wild. Play Dragon Quest at temp 0, then replay at temp 10. Same scenario file, feels like two different games.

## Press Release (If Seeking Coverage)

```
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Kleene: Adaptive AI Text Adventure Engine Launches for Claude Code

[CITY, DATE] - Nathaniel Ramm today announced the launch of Kleene, an open-source adaptive text adventure engine built specifically for Claude Code. Unlike traditional interactive fiction, Kleene features a unique "temperature" system that allows players to control how much AI adaptation occurs during gameplay.

"Traditional text adventures offer branching paths, but they're static," said Ramm. "With Kleene, the same scenario can play out in infinite ways depending on temperature settings and player improvisation. It's the difference between reading a choose-your-own-adventure book and having a conversation with an AI Game Master."

Key innovations include:

- Temperature System (0-10): Controls narrative adaptation from traditional branching to fully emergent storytelling
- Free-Form Improvisation: Players can type any action, not just select from predetermined options
- Hybrid Approach: Combines structured scenario design with AI-powered adaptation

The plugin launches with four diverse scenarios ranging from fantasy adventures to psychological thrillers, with playtimes from 15 to 60 minutes. Creators can author new scenarios using simple YAML format with built-in generation and validation tools.

Kleene is open source (AGPL-3.0) and available now in the Claude Code plugin marketplace.
