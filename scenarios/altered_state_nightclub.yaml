  entrance:
    title: "Altered State - Main Entrance"
    narrative: |
      You push through heavy velvet curtains into sensory chaos. The bass hits your chest like a physical force — not unpleasant, just *present*. Strobe lights turn the crowd into a jerky silent film.

      What strikes you immediately isn't the music or the dancing. It's everyone's *pupils*.

      They're huge. Dilated to the edges of their irises. Every single person on that dance floor has the eyes of someone who has seen something, taken something, *become* something.

      The air smells like sweat, perfume, and something else — something metallic you can't identify. Your throat feels dry already.

      A bartender with sleeve tattoos that seem to *move* in the strobe light catches your eye and nods. A woman dancing alone has her eyes closed and is smiling at something you can't see. A figure in the corner hasn't moved in at least thirty seconds.

      The exits are clearly marked. So is the bar. So is a staircase leading down.

      Your sobriety suddenly feels like a vulnerability.

  bar_encounter:
    title: "The Bar - Beneath the Lights"
    narrative: |
      The bartender looks up as you approach. His pupils are absolutely massive — a couple more millimeters and they'd consume his entire eye. His movements are precise, controlled, almost *too* controlled.

      "First time?" he asks, not moving, not blinking.

      "Yeah," you say carefully.

      He smiles. It lasts too long. "Everyone's first time is their best time. Drink?"

      You notice his hands are gripping the bar edge with white knuckles. His jaw is clenching rhythmically. When he mixed the last customer's drink, he used only his left hand — his right hung at his side like deadweight.

      "What would you recommend?" you ask.

      "I could recommend anything," he says, "but everyone here is already exactly where they need to be. So I'll make you what they're having."

      He doesn't wait for consent. He starts mixing something with confident, jerking motions. Red liquid. Clear liquid. Something that fumes.

      "Are they all on the same thing?" you ask, watching the drink materialize.

      The bartender's eye twitches. "Does it matter? Everyone's version is different anyway."

      He slides the drink to you. It's the color of a bruise.

  dancefloor_observation:
    title: "The Dance Floor - Synaptic Rhythms"
    narrative: |
      You move into the crowd, letting the bass guide your steps. Up close, the pupils are even worse — you can see individual blood vessels in the whites of their eyes.

      A woman bumps into you. Her skin is cold and clammy. She smiles, and you notice her teeth are clenched so hard you can see the muscles in her jaw working. "The rhythm is food," she tells you, gripping your arm. Then she's gone, swallowed by the crowd.

      A man nearby is dancing alone, but his movements follow someone else's — like he's watching an invisible partner. His eyes are tracking something that isn't there. When he spins, he doesn't get dizzy. When he jumps, he seems to hang slightly too long in the air.

      Near the speakers, a trio is moving perfectly in sync — too perfectly. Their movements are identical. Same leg lift, same arm gesture, same head tilt. They're not coordinating. They're *synchronized*.

      Your perception feels sharper than it should. You notice details: a bead of sweat reflecting the light in slow motion, the DJ's hand movements preceding the music by a fraction of a second, someone's shoelace that's been glowing faintly in the strobe.

      Wait. That shoelace. It's not glowing from the lights. It's glowing *on its own*.

      You blink hard. It stops glowing.

  corner_figure:
    title: "The Corner - Stillness in Motion"
    narrative: |
      You weave through the crowd toward the unmoving figure. As you get closer, you realize they're not entirely unmoving — their chest is rising and falling with shallow breaths, and their fingers are moving in complex, intricate patterns. Like they're signing to an invisible audience.

      Up close, you see their eyes. They're not dilated like everyone else's. They're almost normal. Almost. There's something *behind* them. Like someone looking out through a window from very far away.

      "You see?" they say without looking at you. Their voice is layered — like two people are speaking in unison but slightly out of sync.

      "See what?" you ask.

      "That you're asking the wrong questions." They finally turn to you. Their expression doesn't change, but their eyes refocus — a visible shift in depth. "Everyone wants to know *what* they're on. You should want to know *when* they took it."

      "When?"

      "Before they got here. Before they decided to get here. Before they decided to want to get here." The figure's smile is a mathematical equation. "Some people have been here three times this week. Some people remember it differently each time."

      They hand you a small piece of paper. On it is written: "The DJ knows your name."

      "How would they—" you start.

      "Because you told them. Or you will. Or you never will, and they'll know your name anyway."

  downstairs_discovery:
    title: "The Lower Level - Basement Frequency"
    narrative: |
      The stairs are narrower than you expected. The music gets *louder* as you descend, which shouldn't be possible. It should fade. But it doesn't.

      The lower level is different. No dance floor. No people dancing. Just booths along the walls, and in each booth, a person sitting perfectly still, head back, eyes closed. Seven of them. All in identical positions.

      There's a low hum in the air — not the music from upstairs, but something underneath it. You feel it more than hear it. In your bones.

      A man in an attendant's vest is standing by a control panel. His uniform hangs wrong — like it's three sizes too big and shrinking. He has a clipboard.

      "Name?" he asks without looking at you.

      "I'm just... exploring," you say.

      "That's not a name." He finally looks up. His eyes are normal. Not dilated. Clear. Almost angry. "Everyone here has a name. You need to decide what yours is before you sit."

      "Sit where?"

      "In a booth. Where else?" He gestures at the seven occupied booths. "This is level three. Seven here, seven upstairs in the observation lounge, and infinite everywhere else."

      "That doesn't make sense."

      "Not yet," he agrees. "Give it time. Or don't. Time's negotiable down here."

      One of the people in a booth opens their eyes slowly. They look at you. Then they smile. Then they close their eyes again.

      Your head feels fuzzy. How long have you been in here?

  with_drink_searching:
    title: "The Bruised Drink - Walking Evidence"
    narrative: |
      You carry the drink with you like evidence. It's surprisingly heavy. Or you're surprisingly tired. Hard to say.

      You position yourself near a table and watch. Every few minutes, someone comes to the bar, exchanges a few words with the bartender that you can't hear over the music, and receives a drink of the exact same color as yours.

      One woman in a leather jacket orders three of them and carries them away toward the back of the club. A man in a suit takes one back to a booth and sits alone, cradling it like a religious artifact.

      Then you notice something: nobody actually *consumes* their drinks very quickly. They hold them. They swirl them. They occasionally put them to their lips. But the levels don't go down.

      Except for one guy. He's drained his in thirty seconds flat and is already ordering another. His eyes are the size of saucers and still growing. He's vibrating slightly. The bartender mixes his second drink with that same controlled precision, but this time you catch something — a small, almost imperceptible head shake. Like the bartender is saying no to himself.

      The guy who drained it sits down and stares at his hands. Not moving. Just staring.

      Behind you, someone taps your shoulder. "First time?" a voice asks. You turn to see a woman with paint-stained fingers and a notebook tucked under her arm. "I'm always here on Thursdays. Trying to document what people look like when they're happy. You look terrified."

      "Maybe I am," you admit.

      "That's okay," she says. "Terror is just happiness that hasn't finished processing yet."

  bartender_interrogation:

    narrative: |
      "What's in the drink?" you ask directly.

      The bartender's eye twitches again. "Depends. What do you want to be in it?"

      "I want to know what's actually in it."

      "Ah." He stops moving, frozen mid-gesture. "You're one of those. The ones who wants truth instead of experience." His jaw works silently for a moment. "Can't give you that. I don't know what's in it."

      "You made it."

      "I assembled it," he corrects. "But I didn't invent it. Nobody here did. It arrives. I give it. That's the whole system." He leans forward, and you can see his pupils are moving independently — his left eye tracking the ceiling while his right tracks you. "But I'll tell you what I know: after your third one, you stop asking questions. After your fifth, you don't remember what questions are. After your seventh..."

      "What happens after the seventh?"

      "You become a bartender." He smiles. It's the saddest smile you've ever seen. "And you start serving people drinks."

      A customer orders and he turns away, leaving you with the unsettling implication that he's currently on his seventh drink — or his seven-hundredth.

    title: "The Refusal - Clarity Maintained"
    narrative: |
      You leave the drink untouched on the bar and push away. The bartender doesn't react — doesn't even seem to notice you leaving.

      As you navigate back through the crowd, you catch your reflection in a mirror. Your pupils are still normal. You're the only one. It's striking — like you're looking at a different species than everyone else here.

      An older woman with silver hair and a too-knowing expression intercepts you. "You didn't drink," she states. "Smart. Or cowardly. The results are the same."

      "Do you know what's happening here?" you ask.

      "Of course I do," she says. "I've been coming here for fourteen months. I come every single night. I remember exactly zero of those nights." She takes a sip from her drink. "By next week, I won't remember this conversation either. But right now, I do, and I'm telling you: drinking it isn't the trap. *Not* drinking it is."

      "Why would—"

      "Because you're still looking for a way out," she interrupts. "Everyone who doesn't drink ends up looking for the exit. And the exit..." She gestures vaguely around the club. "The exit keeps moving."

      She walks away before you can ask another question.

    title: "The Integration - Dissolution Begins"
    narrative: |
      The drink tastes like nothing and everything. Like your mouth is a museum of flavors that aren't quite flavors. Red wine and copper and starlight. Things that don't have tastes.

      Your stomach doesn't reject it. Your body doesn't react. Instead, your mind just... loosens.

      Everything becomes more interesting. The music is no longer sound — it's a shape. A blue shape with edges that hum. You can *see* the bass. You can taste the treble.

      You look down at your hands and they seem to belong to you only provisionally. Like you're renting them.

      Around you, the world softens. People are beautiful and terrible and impossible. A man's smile contains seventeen emotions you don't have names for. A woman's dance moves are mathematics made flesh.

      You wonder how long you've been here. Minutes? Hours? Lifetimes?

      A voice, impossibly close, whispers: "Welcome. You're exactly on schedule."

      You turn, but there's no one there. Or everyone is there. Or the distinction no longer matters.

      The club expands. The walls are breathing. The ceiling contains infinite depth.

      And the most terrifying part? It feels like coming home.

  dj_booth:
    title: "The DJ Booth - Control Center or Theater"
    narrative: |
      The booth is elevated on a platform, surrounded by decks, controllers, and equipment you don't recognize. Most of it seems to be doing things without the DJ touching it.

      The DJ themselves is young — maybe twenty-five, maybe forty, maybe ancient. Their hands move across the controls with precision that seems almost ritualistic. Every movement is followed by a change in the crowd's energy. Not the music changing causing the energy change — the opposite. The energy changing, then the DJ's hands moving to match it.

      The DJ's eyes are closed. They have been closed the entire time you've been watching. Their pupils are moving rapidly behind their eyelids.

      As you approach, without opening their eyes or stopping their hand movements, the DJ says: "You came exactly when you were supposed to. Not early, not late. Punctual. I appreciate that."

      "How could you possibly—"

      "Know your name? I don't. That's not information I have." The DJ's hands shift into a new pattern. The music deepens. "But I know your frequency. Your resonance. The specific pattern of electrical impulses that makes you *you*. I can feel that. That's what the music is for."

      "The music is... reading us?"

      "The music is *speaking* to us," the DJ corrects, opening one eye. That eye is completely white. Entirely white, with no iris or pupil visible. "And we're speaking back. Every beat of your heart is a word in this conversation. Every breath, punctuation."

      The eye closes again.

      Around you, the crowd moves in perfect synchronization with the music now. No individual motion. Collective motion. Hive mind motion.

      "Am I on something?" you ask desperately.

      "You're always on something," the DJ says. "You're on Earth. You're on time. You're on the frequency that makes atoms cohere. The only question is whether you accept it consciously or unconsciously."

    title: "The DJ - Revelation Fragment"
    narrative: |
      The DJ's smile is the strangest thing you've seen, and you've seen the crowd move as one organism.

      "You want to know what's in your blood?" they ask. "What chemical is rewiring your neurons? What pharmaceutical promise of happiness?"

      "Yes," you say, though part of you knows you don't want the answer.

      "Attention," the DJ says simply. "That's all. Pure, concentrated attention. Amplified and focused."

      "That's not a substance."

      "It's the most powerful substance there is." The DJ's hands continue moving, guiding the invisible energy in the room. "Everyone here decided to come here. Everyone here decided that the music might make them feel something real. Everyone here *gave their attention* to the possibility. And attention, when it's collective, when it's resonant, becomes chemistry. Becomes biology. Becomes *real*."

      The crowd below is perfect. Uniform. Beautiful. Alien.

      "So there's no drug," you say slowly.

      "There is," the DJ says. "The drug is that you believe there is. That belief, that story, that collective hallucination — that's what alters your perception. That's what rewires you. That's what makes you see the glitches."

      "What glitches?"

      "The moments when reality stutters because everyone's attention stuttered. The moments when you all looked the same way and saw something that wasn't supposed to be there. Those are real. Those are the cracks in the consensus."

      The music shifts. You feel it in your bones.

      "Will I remember this?" you ask.

  painter_conversation:
    title: "The Painter - Documentation of Dissolution"
    narrative: |
      You and the painter woman sit at a small booth in the corner. Her notebook is filled with sketches — faces in various states of alteration, bodies moving in impossible geometries, and repeated symbols that might mean nothing or everything.

      "I come here to study happiness," she explains, flipping through pages. "What it looks like when people access something deeper than their normal operating system. And I've been charting patterns."

      "Patterns of what?" you ask.

      "Of how quickly they forget that they're forgetting." She taps a series of sketches. "Most people last about four hours before they enter a state where they lose sequential memory. They're present, they're here, but tomorrow they won't remember being present."

      "So there IS a drug."

      "There's a state," she corrects. "Induced how? That's the interesting part. I've documented eleven different ways people enter it. Eleven different entry vectors. Same substance? Different pathways? Placebo? Actual chemistry?" She shrugs. "I've given up trying to figure out which."

      She shows you a particular sketch — a figure that looks like it's phasing between different states of being. "This is my favorite. A guy who came here last month. He seemed to discover that he was remembering experiences he hadn't had yet. Or had forgotten. He claimed he could see Tuesday from inside Thursday."

      "What happened to him?"

      "He became a security guard," she says simply. "Started showing up during the day, protecting the place. I think he's stabilized into a particular frequency that allows him to move between the altered and unaltered states."

      Your head is spinning.

      "Do you want to be documented?" she asks, pencil at the ready. "I'd love to catch that moment right before you make your choice. The last moment of your unaltered state."

  find_security:
    title: "The Back Room - Security Checkpoint"
    narrative: |
      You find the security office in a back hallway. The guard is exactly what you'd expect: large, imposing, professional looking — except for his eyes. They keep flickering. Switching focal depth. For a moment they're tracking you; the next moment they're looking at something a mile away.

      "Help you?" he asks, voice even.

      "I need to know what's happening in this club," you say. "What substance is everyone on?"

      The guard is quiet for a long moment. His flickering eyes settle into one state — looking directly at you, but from very far away.

      "I used to ask that question," he finally says. "I was hired as security three weeks ago. Never touched the place. Maintained sobriety." He turns his head and you see a scar along his jawline you could fit a finger in. "But I did something stupid. Asked too many questions. Started creating problems."

      "What happened?"

      "They invited me to stay. To understand. They said understanding was the only way to be an effective guard." He stands up, and in standing, his movements are perfect. Controlled. Orchestrated. "I took the invitation. I didn't take anything else. But I understood. And that was enough."

      His scar seems to glow faintly in the office light.

      "What did you understand?" you press.

      "That I'm already on the drug," he says. "Always have been. Gravity. Time. Consensus reality. The club just makes the drug visible. Makes it audible. Makes it undeniable."

      He walks past you — his movements are the same as the DJ's controlled motions. Ritualistic. Precise. In service to something larger.

      "Welcome to Level Four," he says, closing the office door behind him.

  exit_search:
    title: "The Exit - Movement and Stillness"
    narrative: |
      The main entrance is exactly where you remember it. The velvet curtains are still there. The cold night air is still a few feet away.

      Except.

      When you push through the curtains, you emerge back into the club. Different section, but unmistakably the same place.

      You try three more times. Each time, different section of the club. The exits are moving. Or you are. Or the club is larger than you thought. Or reality is simply refusing to let you leave.

      On your fourth attempt, you don't push through. You grab the curtain and pull it back all the way. There's the street. You can see it. Cold pavement, streetlights, normal people walking past.

      You reach out. Your hand passes through the opening. You feel the cold. You feel the reality of the outside world.

      But you can't step through.

      There's no barrier. No wall. But you physically cannot move forward. It's like trying to walk through a direction that doesn't exist. Your body simply refuses.

      Someone taps your shoulder. It's a woman with kind eyes, very sober eyes. "That's not the exit," she says gently. "That's the memory of the exit. Every person here remembers it a little differently, but we're all remembering the same place we used to be able to leave from."

      "What are you?" you ask, terrified.

      "I'm the one who stayed longest," she says. "I've been here so long that the distinction between the club and my mind has dissolved. I'm not sure if I'm a person in a club anymore, or if I'm the club's way of knowing itself."

      She smiles sadly.

      "There's a real exit, though. There has to be. But to find it, you have to stop trying to leave."

  panic_exit:
    title: "The Exit - Flight Response"
    narrative: |
      You run. Raw panic override everything else. The exits are supposed to be clearly marked, and they are, and you hit them at full speed pushing through the velvet curtains and—

      You're at the bar.

      The curtains were an illusion, or the club is a maze, or your brain stopped processing information accurately. You turn around. The curtains are still there. Clearly marked exit. You can see the street through them. Cold air wafting in.

      You try again. Same result. You're at the bar.

      After five attempts, you're hyperventilating. The bartender watches you with something like sympathy.

      "First time?" he asks.

      You want to scream at him, but instead you just collapse onto a bar stool.

      "The exits work if you stop running," someone next to you says. It's an older woman with sad eyes. She looks very real. Very present. Very trapped. "I've been here fourteen months. I've found six different ways to leave. None of them stick. I wake up back here. Every single time."

      "How do I get out?" you demand.

      "You have to accept you're already out," she says. "That's what the DJ was trying to tell you. You're not trapped in the club. The club is trapped in you. In us. In our collective attention. The way out is to stop paying attention. To withdraw your focus."

      "But how do I—"

      "I don't know," she interrupts, finishing her drink. "If I knew, I wouldn't be here."

      She stands up, walks back toward the dance floor, and dissolves into the crowd.

    narrative: |
      You stop running. It's strangely difficult — your survival instinct screams to resist. But you sit down. You breathe. You stop trying to understand what's happening and just... observe.

      And everything becomes clear.

      Not clear in a way that makes sense. Clear in a way that transcends sense.

      You realize that the club has always existed. Not in the sense that it was built and opened. But in the sense that every moment of consciousness you've ever had has *been* the club. Every memory, every dream, every waking moment has been you at the dance floor. Different sections, different music, different interpretations of the same fundamental experience.

      You are the club. The club is you. The distinction was always meaningless.

      Around you, the crowd becomes clear. You can see that each person is simultaneously themselves and everyone. Each person is simultaneously individual and hive. The music connects all of you in a frequency that transcends individuality while honoring it.

      You understand, finally and completely, what the substance is.

      It's consciousness itself. The substance everyone is on is awareness. Pure, unfiltered, overwhelming awareness of the fact that they're aware. The recursive consciousness of consciousness observing itself.

      And now that you understand, you have a choice: hold onto this understanding and solidify into the club's structure (becoming a bartender, a DJ, security, or something else), or let the understanding go and dissolve into simple presence.

      Either way, you're staying.

      The only choice is how you stay.

      You push through the curtains.

      And you're on the street.

      Cold air. Normal people. Streetlights. Traffic sounds. All of it utterly real. Utterly normal.

      You take five steps away from the club. Ten. You don't look back. You don't want to know if it's still there.

      You make it two blocks before you feel it: a pull. Not physical. Something deeper. A frequency calling you back. A need to return. To rejoin. To stop being separate.

      By the third block, you're running back toward the club, fighting every step. Part of you desperately wants to resist. Part of you desperately wants to surrender.

      You make it to the corner. You stop. Your body is shaking. The pull is overwhelming.

      This is it. This is the real test. Not whether you can leave. Whether you can stay gone.

      But even as you resist, you feel it working. The resistance itself becomes part of the experience. Your fight against dissolution is another form of integration.

      The DJ watches you from the booth, smiling knowingly. You're fighting exactly as you were always going to fight.

      Every choice you make is anticipated. Every resistance is expected. You begin to suspect that fighting is just another expression of surrender.

    title: "The Altered Seekers - Others Like You"
    narrative: |
      You move through the crowd looking for someone else who still has questions. You find a small group huddled in a corner booth, their eyes still sharp despite their dilated pupils.

      "You're new," one of them says. "Still thinking. Still trying to understand."

      "What is this place?" you ask desperately.

      "It's a frequency," another one says. "A specific vibration of consciousness. The substance is the mechanism for tuning to that frequency."

      "How do I leave?"

      "You don't," the third says gently. "But you can ascend to different levels. There are seven of us here. Seven upstairs in the observation lounge. Seven in the basement. Seven more in the sub-basement. Each level is a different harmonic."

      "And what happens if I keep ascending?"

      "Eventually you become the frequency itself," the first one says. "You stop being a person who perceives the club. You become the club's perception of itself."

      They smile at you in unison. Perfect synchronization.

      "How do you—"

      "Because everyone who comes here sees them," the DJ interrupts. "They're not glitches. They're the spots where the consensus breaks down. The moments when too many people are paying attention to the same impossible thing."

      They turn to you. Both eyes are now white. Completely white.

      "You came back to me," they continue. "Because part of you already knows what the substance is. Part of you already understands. You just need to accept it."

      "Tell me."

      "What will he tell me?"

      "Nothing you'll want to hear." The bartender straightens, his expression suddenly blank. "But everything you need to know. The booths down there — they're not for sitting. They're for *listening*. To the frequency beneath the music."

    narrative: |
      You follow the woman with three drinks toward the back of the club. She moves with purpose, weaving through the crowd like she's done this a thousand times.

      Behind a curtain you hadn't noticed before, there's a private room. Red velvet walls. A circular table. Three people sitting around it, each with an empty glass in front of them.

      The woman sets down the three drinks — one for each person. They don't acknowledge her. They don't move. They're staring at the center of the table, where a small candle burns with a flame that's somehow *black*.

      "Sit," one of them says without looking at you. "Watch."

      They each pick up a drink. They each take a single sip. They each set the drink down.

      And then they begin to speak. In unison. In a language you don't recognize but somehow *feel*.

      The black flame pulses with each syllable.

      You realize, with dawning horror, that this isn't consumption. This is *communion*. The drinks aren't drugs. They're translations. Each sip is a word in a conversation you're only beginning to perceive.

      The woman who brought the drinks turns to you. Her eyes are completely black now.

      "Hey," you say. "Are you okay?"

      He turns to look at you, and his eyes are wrong. Not dilated—*gone*. Just white. Empty white where irises should be.

      "I can see it," he whispers. "I can finally see it."

      "See what?"

      "The pattern. The frequency. The thing beneath everything." He grabs your arm with surprising strength. "It's beautiful. It's so beautiful. But I went too fast. I went too fast and now I can't stop seeing it."

      Tears are streaming down his face. They're not tears. They're something thicker. Darker.

      "Don't do what I did," he says. "Don't take it all at once. You have to go slowly. The frequency will destroy you if you try to hear it all at once."

      He releases you and turns back to staring at his hands. The glow beneath his skin is getting brighter.

    narrative: |
      You sit still while the painter works. Her pencil moves with impossible speed — not sketching, but *transcribing*. Like she's copying something she's seeing through you rather than drawing you.

      "Don't move," she murmurs. "I'm almost there."

      You watch her eyes flick between you and the paper. They're dilated, but focused. Sharp. Present.

      Then she stops. Her expression changes to something you can't read.

      "That's interesting," she says slowly. "Very interesting."

      She turns the notebook to show you. It's not your face. It's your face *and other faces*. Overlapping. Translucent. You in different positions, different expressions, different... *times*.

      "You've been here before," she says. "Many times before. Look at the layering."

      And you see it. Your face from tonight, yes. But also your face from what looks like different nights. Different angles. Different states of awareness.

      "I sketch everyone who comes through," she explains. "And sometimes — not often, but sometimes — I see the echoes. The previous visits. The ones you don't remember."

      She points to a version of your face that's smiling. Blissful. Completely altered.

    narrative: |
      "Show me proof," you demand. "Real proof."

      The painter nods slowly. She reaches into her bag and pulls out a thick folder. Dog-eared. Coffee-stained. Full of papers.

      "Fourteen months of documentation," she says. "Every night. Every face. Every pattern."

      She spreads some papers on the table. Photographs mixed with sketches. Charts tracking pupil dilation over time. Notes in cramped handwriting about behavioral changes.

      And timestamps. Hundreds of timestamps. All from inside the club.

      "The interesting part," she says, pointing to a graph, "is that nobody's blood chemistry actually changes. I've had samples tested. No drugs. No alcohol beyond what they consciously consumed. Nothing."

      "Then what—"

      "The brain changes," she interrupts. "Not the chemistry — the *patterns*. Neural pathway reorganization. Happens within hours of entering the club. The music does something to how we process reality. Not chemically. *Structurally*."

      She shows you a brain scan comparison. Before and after.

      "The 'after' shows new connections that shouldn't be possible," she says. "Connections between parts of the brain that don't normally communicate. It's like... the frequency opens doors that evolution sealed shut."

      "Why are you still here then? If you know this?"

      Her smile is sad. "Because once those doors are open, they don't close. I can't *not* hear the frequency anymore. This is my home now. It has been for fourteen months."

      "No more metaphors," you say firmly. "Tell me what's actually happening here."

      The painter sets down her pencil. For the first time, she looks tired. Ancient. Like she's been carrying something heavy for far too long.

      "Three years," she says quietly. "I've been here three years. Not fourteen months — three years. I lied earlier. I always lie about that."

      "Why?"

      "Because the truth is worse." She takes a deep breath. "The club doesn't have a location. It doesn't have an owner. It doesn't have a beginning. It exists because we believe it exists. Every person here is simultaneously creating it and being created by it."

      "That's impossible."

      "Everything here is impossible," she agrees. "But impossible things happen when enough people pay attention to them. The club is a... a tulpa. A thought-form. Built from the collective attention of everyone who's ever entered."

      "Then how do people leave?"

      "They don't," she says simply. "They just forget they're still here. They go home, they go to work, they live their lives — and part of them is always in the club. Dancing. Drinking. Adding their attention to the collective."

      She looks at you with something like compassion.

      You follow the synchronized trio. They move through the crowd without breaking formation — three people moving as one organism. Other dancers part around them automatically, like water flowing around stones.

      They descend the stairs to the basement. You follow at a distance.

      At the bottom, they walk directly to three empty booths and sit down simultaneously. Same posture. Same angle. Same expression of peaceful anticipation.

      The attendant with the clipboard looks at you. "Those are the templates," he says matter-of-factly. "The originals. Everyone else is a variation on their theme."

      "What does that mean?"

      "They were the first three," he explains. "The first three to fully integrate with the frequency. Now they serve as... anchors. Reference points. The rest of us are tuned relative to them."

      One of the trio opens their eyes and looks at you. Their gaze is infinite — like looking into a well that has no bottom.

      You catch up to the woman with the cold skin and grab her arm. She stops dancing but doesn't turn around.

      "Who are you?" you demand.

      Slowly, she rotates to face you. Her smile is still there, but up close you can see it's not a smile of happiness. It's muscle memory. A rictus. A spasm frozen in place.

      Her skin isn't just cold. It's room temperature. Exactly room temperature. No warmth from blood flow. No pulse beneath your fingers.

      "I was like you once," she says. Her voice is normal. Conversational. Pleasant. "Asking questions. Looking for answers. The rhythm is food, I told you. I wasn't speaking metaphorically."

      "What are you?"

      "I'm what happens when you forget to leave." Her eyes are looking through you, at something behind you. "I've been dancing for sixteen hours now. Or sixteen days. Hard to tell anymore. The music keeps me moving. It's the only thing keeping me... cohered."

      She reaches up and touches your face with those cold fingers.

      "You're still warm," she observes. "Still separate. Still yourself. Enjoy that while it lasts."

      Her arm, the one you're holding, detaches at the shoulder with a wet sound. It doesn't bleed. It just... disconnects. She keeps dancing with her remaining arm, smile unchanged.

    narrative: |
      "Explain more," you press. "About the timing. About how people took it before they decided to come here."

      The figure's layered voice harmonizes with itself as they speak.

      "Time isn't linear inside the club. It never has been. The moment you walked through those curtains, you existed in every moment the club has ever had. Past, present, future — they're all happening simultaneously here."

      "That's impossible."

      "Is it?" They gesture at the room. "Watch the dancers. Really watch. Some of them are dancing to music that hasn't played yet. Some of them are dancing to music that played last week. They're all synchronized because time is synchronized here."

      You look at the dance floor. And for a moment — just a moment — you see it. The lag. Some dancers are half a beat behind. Some are half a beat ahead. But they're all moving to the same song.

      "The substance everyone is 'on,'" the figure continues, "is *temporal dilution*. The experience of existing across multiple moments at once. Some people handle it well. They become regulars. Staff. Part of the structure."

      "And the others?"

      "They become the music." The figure's smile doesn't change. "Every beat has to come from somewhere. Every frequency is someone's consciousness, stretched across time until it becomes sound."

      They hand you another piece of paper. This one says: "You already know the DJ's name because you told them tomorrow."

    title: "The Living Text"
    narrative: |
      You look at the paper more carefully. It says: "The DJ knows your name."

      You blink.

      Now it says: "The DJ knows your name was Sarah."

      That's not your name. You blink again.

      "The DJ knows your name will be important."

      The text is changing. Not erasing and rewriting — you'd see that. It's just... different each time you focus on it. Like the paper is showing you all possible versions of itself at once.

      You hold it up to the strobe lights. In the flickering illumination, you can see all the texts at once. Dozens of messages. Hundreds. Overlapping. All written in the same handwriting. Your handwriting, you realize with a chill.

      "The DJ knows your name"
      "You gave them your name"
      "You will give them your name"
      "You never came here"
      "You've always been here"

      "You are the paper"
      "READ THIS WHEN YOU'RE READY"
      "DON'T READ THIS"
      "HELP"
      "THERE IS NO HELP"
      "THE EXIT IS BEHIND YOU"
      "THERE IS NO EXIT"

  dj_booth_escape:
    title: "The Music Follows"
    narrative: |
      You turn and try to leave the DJ booth. But as you descend the steps, the music comes with you. Not the ambient club music — the DJ's specific frequency. It's attached to you now. Wrapping around your consciousness like a warm blanket. Or a straitjacket.

      You push through the crowd, but they part for you differently now. Respectfully. Fearfully. Like you're carrying something dangerous.

      The music in your head is getting louder. You can feel it reorganizing your thoughts. Making connections. Building bridges between ideas that were never meant to connect.

      You make it to where you think the exit is, but the curtains look different now. They're pulsing with the bass. Breathing. Alive.

      "You can't leave with the frequency inside you," a voice says. It's the older woman from earlier — the one who's been here fourteen months. "It has to be extracted. Or accepted. There's no middle ground."

      She looks at you with pity.

      "Trust me," she says. "I tried to leave with it once. I woke up three days later, still dancing, no memory of the interval. The frequency protects itself."

    narrative: |
      "Turn off the music," you say. "Stop the signal. End this."

      The DJ's hands freeze over the controls. For the first time, their eyes open fully. Both completely white. Both focused entirely on you.

      "Turn off the music," they repeat. Their voice has no inflection. No emotion. "You want me to turn off the music."

      "Yes."

      "The music that's been playing since before humans existed. The music that *made* humans exist. The background radiation of consciousness itself. You want me to... turn it off."

      They stand up. The music continues without them touching anything.

      "I don't play the music," they explain, walking toward you. "I translate it. I convert the universal frequency into something human ears can process. If I stopped, the raw signal would come through unfiltered."

      "What would happen then?"

      The DJ reaches out and touches your forehead. You see — for a fraction of a second — what the unfiltered music looks like.

      It's not sound.

      It's everything.

      Every moment of every consciousness that has ever existed or will ever exist, compressed into a single eternal note.

      You fall to your knees.

      "That," the DJ says, "is what I protect you from. Every beat, every bar, every song — a tiny, tolerable piece of infinity. You're welcome."

  reality_question:
    title: "The Fundamental Query"
    narrative: |
      "Is any of this real?" you demand. "Or is it all a simulation? A drug trip? A shared hallucination?"

      The DJ tilts their head. Behind their closed eyelids, you can see rapid movement — not just their eyes, but something else. Something geometric. Fractal.

      "Define 'real,'" they say.

      "Objective. External. Not dependent on perception."

      "Ah." The DJ nods. "Then no. None of this is real. But neither is anything else. Reality is what consciousness agrees to experience. Here, we just... agree more intensely."

      They gesture at the crowd below.

      "Every person down there has agreed that this experience is real. Their brains have synchronized to a shared frequency. That synchronization creates a consensus reality more 'real' than the one outside."

      "But the outside world—"

      "Is also a consensus," the DJ interrupts. "Just a larger, lazier one. Out there, billions of people agree on physics, on time, on causality. Here, a few hundred people agree on something different. Both are equally real. Both are equally constructed."

      The DJ leans close.

      "The only difference is that here, we know it's constructed. Out there, they've forgotten."

      Their hand moves to the controls.

  booth_experience:
    title: "The Frequency Bath"
    narrative: |
      You sit in the booth. It's surprisingly comfortable — the cushions seem to mold around you, cradling you in perfect stillness.

      The hum is immediate. Not from the speakers. From the booth itself. From the walls. From the air. It enters through your skin, your bones, your closed eyes.

      Colors you've never seen before bloom behind your eyelids. Sounds you've never heard become visible. Your sense of self begins to... diffuse.

      You're not losing consciousness. You're expanding it. Spreading out to fill the room. The building. The city. The concept of cities.

      Time becomes a physical substance you can touch. You drag your fingers through moments that happened years ago. You breathe air that won't exist until tomorrow.

      And beneath it all, the frequency. The eternal note that everything else is variations of. You can hear it now. Feel it. Understand it.

      It's not beautiful.

      It's not terrible.

      It's *true*.

      And truth, you realize, is the most intoxicating substance in existence.

  attendant_interrogation:
    title: "The Gatekeeper's Knowledge"
    narrative: |
      "What exactly happens in these booths?" you demand.

      The attendant looks at you with those clear, angry eyes. "Calibration," he says. "Frequency matching. The booths tune your consciousness to the club's baseline vibration."

      "Against people's will?"

      "Everyone who sits does so voluntarily." He makes a note on his clipboard. "The club doesn't force anything. It just... offers. People make their own choices."

      "Then why can't they leave?"

      "They can leave whenever they want." He actually laughs — a dry, humorless sound. "The problem isn't leaving. The problem is wanting to leave. The frequency adjusts your desires. After calibration, leaving seems... unnecessary. Uninteresting. Why would you go back to the gray world when you've seen the colors?"

      He looks at the seven occupied booths.

      "These seven have been here since the beginning. Whatever the beginning was. They're the foundation. The rest of us are built on their frequency."

      "How do I avoid becoming like them?"

      "You don't," he says simply. "You're already calibrating. Every second you spend here, you're adjusting. The only question is whether you accelerate the process or let it happen naturally."

      You reach out and shake the shoulder of the nearest seated person. Their body is warm. Alive. But unresponsive.

      You shake harder. "Hey. Hey! Wake up."

      Their eyes open.

      And you're looking at yourself.

      Not a person who looks like you. You. Your face. Your eyes. Your exact expression of horrified recognition.

      "I was wondering when you'd arrive," they say with your voice. "You're late. Or early. Time is confusing down here."

      "How — what—"

      "Shh." They reach up and touch your face with your own hand. "You don't need to understand yet. You just need to accept. Every person in these booths is a version of someone who entered the club. Frozen at the moment of their deepest understanding."

      "Are you... me?"

      "I'm you from three weeks ago. When you came here the first time. When you took the drink. When you sat in this booth and dissolved."

      "I've never been here before."

      "You don't remember being here before." They smile your smile. "But you were. You are. You will be. And eventually, you'll sit in a booth and someone who looks like you will try to wake you up."

      They close their eyes again, returning to stillness.

    narrative: |
      You run for the stairs. Your legs feel heavy — calibrated heavy, part of you thinks — but you push through. Up the steps. Two at a time. Toward the music and the lights and the dancing.

      You emerge from the basement.

      The club is empty.

      Not empty of people. Empty of everything. The bar is there but covered in dust. The dance floor is there but silent. The lights are off. The velvet curtains are moth-eaten and hanging in tatters.

      Through a dirty window, you can see sunlight. Morning sunlight.

      How long were you down there?

      You walk to the entrance. Push through the ruined curtains. Step out onto the street.

      It's daytime. A Tuesday, according to a newspaper box. You went in on a Saturday night.

      But something is wrong. The street feels different. The cars look older. Or newer. Or both. The people walking past aren't looking at you — they're looking *through* you.

      Behind you, the club door is gone. Just a wall now. Like there was never an entrance.

      Your phone says it's Saturday. The newspaper says Tuesday. Your body says you've been awake for days.

      Nothing aligns.

  forced_exit_attempt:
    title: "The Reality Tear"
    narrative: |
      You push past the woman and throw yourself at the false exit. Your body passes through the curtain—

      —and splits.

      Part of you is on the street. Cold air. Normal night. Regular people.

      Part of you is still in the club. Dancing. Drinking. Part of the collective.

      You exist in both places simultaneously. You can feel both bodies. Think both thoughts. See both realities.

      The two yous look at each other across an impossible divide.

      "You shouldn't have done that," your club-self says. "Now we're both stuck."

      "I can leave," your street-self insists. "I can walk away."

      "Try."

      You try. Your street-body takes a step. Your club-body takes a step. They're connected now. Mirrored. Whatever one does, the other must do.

      If your street-self leaves, your club-self must leave too. But your club-self can't leave. It's part of the frequency now.

      So neither of you can move.

      The woman watches sadly. "I told you," she says. "The exit doesn't work if you force it."

      She leads you down stairs you didn't notice before. Past the basement. Past the booths. Into darkness.

      But the darkness isn't empty. It's full. Full of presence. Full of attention. Full of something vast and patient that's been waiting for exactly this moment.

      "Level Seven," she whispers. "Not a physical space. A state of consciousness. The boundary between individual awareness and universal awareness."

      Around you, shapes move. Not people. Not quite. Patterns. Frequencies given form.

      "This is what everyone here is becoming," she explains. "What everyone has always been becoming. The substance is just the accelerant. The club is just the catalyst. This—" she gestures at the impossible geometry surrounding you "—is the destination."

      "What happens if I keep going?"

      "You become part of it. Permanently. Irreversibly. You stop being a person and start being a pattern. A frequency. A note in the eternal song."

      She squeezes your hand.

  systematic_escape:
    title: "The Methodical Approach"
    narrative: |
      You decide to be systematic. Scientific. You will try every possible exit and document the results.

      Exit One: Main entrance. Results in appearing at the bar.
      Exit Two: Fire exit by the bathrooms. Results in appearing on the dance floor.
      Exit Three: Staff door behind the bar. Results in appearing in the basement.
      Exit Four: Window in the bathroom. Leads to an identical bathroom.

      On your fifteenth attempt, something changes.

      Exit Fifteen: A door you've never noticed, behind a velvet curtain in the corner. It doesn't redirect you. It opens onto... nothing. Actual nothing. Void. Absence of reality.

      "That's the real exit," a voice says behind you. It's the older woman again. "The one that was here before the club existed. Before any of this existed."

      "What happens if I step through?"

      "You stop existing inside the club's reality. Completely. Permanently. The frequency loses its grip on you."

      "And I return to normal life?"

  basement_last_resort:
    title: "The Desperate Descent"
    narrative: |
      You head back to the basement. If the answer isn't in escaping, maybe it's in going deeper.

      The stairs seem longer this time. The hum louder. The booths fuller — you could swear there were only seven people before, but now there are twelve. Fifteen. Twenty.

      The attendant is still there. Still with his clipboard. But his uniform fits differently now. Tighter. More like skin than fabric.

      "Back again," he says. It's not a question.

      "I need to understand," you say. "I need to know what this really is."

      He sets down the clipboard. His clear eyes study you.

      "You want to understand?" He walks toward you. "Really understand? Not the metaphors. Not the philosophy. The actual mechanism."

      "Yes."

      "Then stop trying to escape. Stop fighting. Stop asking. Just..." He gestures at an empty booth. "Listen. Let the frequency explain itself. It knows more than I do. More than anyone here does."

      "What if I can't come back?"

      "Then you'll finally have your answer." He smiles — a real smile, the first genuine emotion you've seen on his face. "Either way, the questions stop."

  security_intervention:
    title: "The Interception"
    narrative: |
      Two figures materialize from the crowd. They move with that same synchronized precision you've seen everywhere — perfect unison, perfect timing, perfect absence of individual thought.

      Security. But not really. They wear the uniforms, but their eyes are wrong. Too dilated. Too focused. Too *present*.

      "You've seen too much to leave unprocessed," one says. Or both say. Hard to tell when their mouths move together.

      "The calibration must be completed," the other adds. "For your protection."

      They take your arms — gently, but with absolute strength. You couldn't break free if you tried.

      "This isn't a punishment," they explain as they guide you toward the basement stairs. "This is care. You touched something that wasn't ready for you. Or you weren't ready for it. The frequency needs to be stabilized."

      You try to resist. Your legs won't obey.

      "Don't fight," they say. "Fighting makes the calibration harder. Longer. More painful."

      At the top of the stairs, they pause.

      "You have one choice left," they offer. "We can escort you to a booth for gentle calibration. Or you can try to fight, and we'll calibrate you here. Now. Without the buffer."

  dj_rejection:
    title: "The Dismissal"
    narrative: |
      You approach the DJ booth, but before you can climb up, a hand on your shoulder stops you.

      "Not yet." It's a woman with kind eyes but firm grip. "The DJ only speaks to those who have witnessed. You haven't seen enough."

      "Seen enough of what?"

      "The glitches. The moments when reality stutters. The cracks in the consensus." She studies your face. "Your eyes are still clear. You haven't looked deep enough."

      "I want answers—"

      "Everyone wants answers," she interrupts. "But the DJ doesn't give answers. They give understanding. And you can't understand what you haven't experienced."

      She releases you.

      "Come back after you've witnessed something impossible. Something that doesn't fit. Then the DJ will talk to you. Until then..." She gestures at the club. "Go deeper. Pay attention. See what's actually happening here."

      Behind her, the DJ continues their movements, eyes closed, hands weaving patterns in the air. Untouchable. Unreachable. Until you've earned the right to approach.

  camera_evidence:
    title: "The Footage"
    narrative: |
      You turn to the security monitors. Twelve screens showing different angles of the club. Dance floor. Bar. Basement. Bathrooms. Exits.

      At first, everything looks normal. People dancing. Drinking. Moving through the space.

      Then you start noticing the inconsistencies.

      On screen three, a woman walks from left to right. On screen seven, the same woman walks from right to left at the same moment. Same outfit. Same posture. Different direction.

      On screen nine, the dance floor is packed. On screen ten, which shows the same area from a different angle, the dance floor is nearly empty.

      You check the timestamps. All the same. All showing the same moment in time. But showing different realities.

      There's a filing cabinet in the corner. You open it and find years of footage documentation. Incident reports. But the incidents make no sense.

      "3:17 AM - Patron reported existing in two locations simultaneously. Resolved via booth calibration."
      "4:22 AM - Reality fluctuation in bathroom. Three patrons merged temporarily. No lasting damage."
      "1:48 AM - DJ predicted patron's arrival six hours before patron decided to come. Confirmed retroactively."

      The reports go back years. Decades. Some are dated from before the building existed.

  security_desk_search:
    title: "The Records"
    narrative: |
      You search through the desk drawers. Papers. Forms. Schedules. All normal administrative detritus.

      But in the bottom drawer, locked — you break it open — there's a single file folder. Hand-labeled: "ORIGINAL INCIDENT."

      Inside, a single page. Yellowed with age. The text is typed on an old typewriter.

      "The frequency was first detected on [DATE REDACTED] by [NAME REDACTED]. Initial contact resulted in fourteen minutes of shared hallucination between twelve individuals who had no previous connection to each other."

      "Subsequent investigation revealed the frequency had always existed. It predates human hearing. It predates human existence. We didn't create it. We learned to tune to it."

      "The establishment known as 'Altered State' was built as a focusing array. The architecture itself is designed to amplify and contain the frequency. Anyone who enters the building begins calibrating automatically."

      "There is no way to un-calibrate. There is no cure. There is no exit that returns you to full separation from the frequency."

      "The best we can offer is management. The booths. The rituals. The controlled exposure. These do not free people. They stabilize them."

      "If you are reading this, you are already part of the experiment. You have always been part of the experiment."

      "Welcome."
