  arrival:
    narrative: |
      The train shudders to a halt at Bundanyabba. You step onto the platform into a wall of heat — forty bloody degrees, easy.
      The air shimmers above the tracks like a fever dream.

      You're a schoolteacher from Sydney, bonded to two years at a remote outback school in Tiboonda. This is supposed to be a quick stopover before your flight home for Christmas. Your girlfriend Robyn is waiting. Your real life is waiting.
      You've got enough quid for the flight and a bit extra. One night in this mining town, then freedom.

      The locals call this place "The Yabba." They say it with affection, like a nickname for an old mate. Everyone reckons it's the best little place on earth.

      As you disembark, you notice an Aboriginal man sitting alone at the front of the carriage, gazing out the window at the red earth. He hasn't moved. The white passengers — miners, mostly, already drunk — push past without acknowledging him.
      The Aboriginal man catches your eye through the window. Just for a moment.

      You walk the main street of Bundanyabba. It's not much — a few pubs, a general store, a post office, the RSL club. Everything bakes under the relentless sun.

      Miners in work clothes move between pubs. Women with shopping bags hurry past, heads down. Children chase each other through the dust.

      There's a memorial in the town square — something about the war. Names etched in bronze. Most of the same surnames repeat: Crawford, Hynes, Tydon.

      Everyone dies here, you think. Or they become part of it.

      A police officer approaches, broad smile on his sunburned face. "G'day! New to the 'Yabba? I'm Jock Crawford. Let me shout you a drink."

      He's already steering you toward the pub before you can answer.

      He pauses at a weathered building. "And that's Doc Tydon's surgery. Well, used to be. He's more of a... freelance medical consultant now." Jock winks.

      "But here's the thing—" Jock leans in conspiratorially. "He's happier now than he ever was. Reckons he is, anyway. Says The Yabba set him free."

      He shrugs. "Bloke's a bit odd. But he's one of us now. That's what matters."

      In the distance, you see a shambling figure emerge from a tin shack on the edge of town. Even from here, you can see the intelligence in his eyes, the ruin in his posture.

      You stand on the platform as the train disappears, thinking about that look in his eyes. This land was his people's for forty thousand years. Now it belongs to men like Jock Crawford and Tim Hynes, to the miners and the drunks and the two-up spinners.

      What does The Yabba look like to him? What truths does he see that you're blind to?

      Dear Robyn,

      You stare at the blank page. What do you say? That you're stuck in some godforsaken mining town in the middle of nowhere? That the heat is unbearable and the locals won't leave you alone?

      You write about the train journey. The red earth. The endless sky. You make it sound like an adventure, even though it feels like a prison sentence.

      "I'll be home for Christmas," you write. "I promise."

      But as you seal the envelope, doubt creeps in. Will you? Can you?

      The hotel manager takes the letter. "Post goes out tomorrow arvo," he says. "Should reach Sydney in a week."

      A week. Robyn won't know where you are for a week.

      Outside, the sun is setting. The pub is calling.

      Morning. You wake early, pack your bags, and head to the airstrip.

      You made it. One night in The Yabba, and you're still yourself.

      At the airstrip, the pilot is doing preflight checks. "Sydney flight?" he asks.

      "Sydney flight."

      He nods. "Ten minutes."

      Doc Tydon was a surgeon. Tim Hynes could have been anything. Janette dreams of escape but can't bring herself to leave.

      Her name is Janette. Tim Hynes' daughter. She works at the pub some afternoons, she tells you, to get out of the house.

      "Dad's always got his mates over," she says, refilling your glass without asking. "Drinking. Talking about nothing. It never bloody ends."

      She's pretty in a faded way. Tired eyes. Quick smile that doesn't quite reach them.

      "You're not from here," she says. It's not a question.

      "Just passing through."

      She laughs — bitter, knowing. "That's what they all say."

      Jock is watching from across the bar, frowning slightly. He doesn't like being ignored.

      Three beers later — Jock won't let you buy a single one — you're hearing about The Yabba's history, its mines, its characters. Jock knows everyone.

      "You should come to the RSL," he says. "Memorial service tonight. Then I'll show you real entertainment."

      He winks. There's something knowing in it.

      You're starting to feel the beers. The room has taken on a pleasant blur.

      The RSL club is packed with miners and their missus. A memorial service is underway — something about the war, about sacrifice. The speaker's voice drones on while blokes drink steadily.

      There's something disconcerting about it all. The reverence mixed with casual drinking. The way people mouth the words of hymns while their eyes stay dead.

      Jock introduces you to a man called Doc Tydon. He's different from the others — educated, clearly, but with a vagrant's clothes and a drunk's eyes.

      "I'm a doctor of medicine," Doc says by way of introduction. "And a tramp by temperament. Also an alcoholic. My disease made practice in Sydney... impractical. But out here it's scarcely noticeable."

      He looks you up and down. "A schoolteacher, eh? Slumming it in the 'Yabba. Tell me — do you reckon you're better than us?"

      The two-up ring is in a back room, smoky and loud. Blokes crowd around a marked circle on the floor. A man called the "spinner" tosses two pennies high into the air using a flat wooden paddle — the "kip."

      "Come in, spinner!" someone shouts.

      "Heads or tails," Jock explains. "Simple as that, mate. Two heads, you win. Two tails, they win. One of each, spin again."

      The spinner tosses. The coins catch the light, spinning, spinning... they land. Two heads. A roar goes up.

      "Fair go!" "Good on ya, spinner!"

      "Try your luck," Jock says, pressing some quid into your hand. "First bet's on me, mate."

      You watch another round. The money changes hands fast. Some bloke wins fifty quid in thirty seconds.

      You lose again. And again. You can't stop. Each loss demands another bet to make it right. The quid drains away — your winnings, your savings, your flight money, everything.

      When you finally stumble back from the ring, your pockets are empty. Flat bloody broke. The crowd has moved on to fresh meat. No one looks at you anymore.

      You're stranded. Trapped in the 'Yabba with no money, no way home, and a Christmas flight you can't afford.

      "Wreck the place!" someone shouts.

      And they do. Tables overturned. Bottles shattered. The publican — an old bloke who looks terrified — backs into a corner as the men systematically destroy his livelihood.

      "You're not like them," he says. "Why you with 'em?"

      You don't have an answer.

      "There's a supply truck comes through tomorrow," he says. "Heads to Broken Hill. From there you can get anywhere. I could put in a word — get you on it."

      The Yabba shrinks in the mirror. Getting smaller. Finally disappearing.

      The two-up ring is behind the RSL, same as before. The same faces, the same ritual. "Come in, spinner!"

      You scrape together what little you have. A few coins. Enough for one bet.

      The pennies flash in the lamplight. Heads. Tails. The crowd cheers or groans.

      You lose.

      You bet again. Lose again.

      The familiar spiral. The desperate hope that the next spin will change everything. It doesn't. It never does.

      Within an hour, you're cleaned out. Again. Worse than before.

      "Come with me."

      She laughs — that bitter laugh. "I told you. I can't."

      Doc appears on the road, walking toward Tim's place. He sees you reading and stops.

      Sometimes you think about Sydney. About Robyn. About the schoolroom in Tiboonda. But those thoughts come less often now, and when they do, they feel like memories of someone else's life.

      "Have another drink, mate."

      The words won't come. Everything sounds like an excuse. Because it is an excuse.

      You stare at the blank paper for hours. The pub empties and fills and empties again around you.

      Finally, you write one sentence:

      "I'm still alive, but I don't know who I am anymore."

      You fold the letter. Address it. Hand it to the publican to post.

      Whether she receives it, whether she reads it, whether she cares — you'll never know. But you wrote it. You admitted the truth, if only on paper.

      The rifle is heavy. Loaded.

      You linger at the station, letting your senses absorb this place before committing to it.

      The heat has a weight to it, pressing down like a physical thing. The air smells of dust and diesel and something else — eucalyptus, maybe, or the red earth itself.

      You notice details: the faded timetables on the board, unchanged for years. The Aboriginal artwork on the waiting room wall, tucked in a corner where tourists might miss it. The way the platform faces west, toward the interior, away from everything you know.

      On the memorial plaque by the door, you read names — Crawford, Hynes, Tydon — the same surnames that will follow you through this town like a curse. The Yabba has existed for generations. It has swallowed men before.

      You understand something now: this isn't just a stopover. It's a threshold.

      You think about walking. Just walking — out of town, down the highway, anywhere but here.

      But there's nothing. Red dirt and heat mirages in every direction. The next town is fifty miles away. Without water, without shade, you'd be dead before nightfall.

      The train you arrived on has already departed. The next one isn't until tomorrow afternoon. You're trapped here whether you like it or not.

      You study the memorial more closely. The names repeat: Crawford. Hynes. Tydon. Crawford again. Hynes again.

      World War I. World War II. Korea. Vietnam. The same families, generation after generation, sending their sons into the meat grinder.

      And the ones who came back? You look around at the miners drinking at midday, the women hurrying past with their heads down, the children who'll grow up to be just like their fathers.

      The Yabba doesn't just trap individuals. It traps bloodlines. It consumes families whole, decade after decade, and calls it community.

      You think of Doc — a surgeon from Sydney, brilliant by all accounts, now drinking himself to death in a tin shack. Was he consumed? Or did he choose this?

      You hang back and watch the faces instead of the coins.

      There's a pattern. The winners howl, slap backs, buy rounds. They're heroes for thirty seconds. Then they bet again, bigger, chasing the feeling.

      The losers laugh too — at first. Then they go quiet. Then they bet again, desperate, trying to claw back what they've lost.

      No one walks away ahead. Not really. The house doesn't take a cut here — there is no house — but the game takes everything anyway. The winners keep playing until they become losers. The losers keep playing until they're broken.

      But there's more. Philosophy: Marcus Aurelius, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer. Poetry: Yeats, Eliot, Judith Wright. And at the end, a battered copy of Kenneth Cook's novel about a schoolteacher trapped in an outback town.

      You pull out the Meditations. It falls open to a marked passage:

      "You have power over your mind — not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."

      They can't attack the heat, the isolation, the grinding poverty of spirit. So they attack something they can break. And afterward, they rebuild, and drink, and wait for the next hunt, the next excuse to let the pressure out.

      Understanding isn't forgiveness. But it's something.

      SURVIVAL

      You return to Tiboonda — the same dusty schoolroom, the same
      thirty kids, the same two-year bond.

      But you're different now.

      The 'Yabba stripped away your pretensions, your certainties,
      your comfortable sense of superiority. It showed you the
      primitive heart beating beneath civilisation's thin veneer.

      You carry the scar. You carry the memory. You carry the
      knowledge of what you're capable of — both the darkness and
      the light.

      Doc was right about one thing: discontent is a luxury of
      the well-to-do. If you've gotta live somewhere, you might
      as well like it.

      The school year begins. The children file in. You pick up
      the chalk and begin to teach.

      ESCAPE

      You made it out. The flight to Sydney. Christmas with Robyn.
      Your civilised life intact.

      But something lingers — a question you can't shake.

      What if you had stayed? What would you have learned about
      yourself in that crucible of heat, beer, and brutal honesty?

      You return to Tiboonda after Christmas. The same schoolroom.
      The same bond. The same two years stretching ahead.

      Sometimes, grading papers late at night, you think about
      the 'Yabba. About the friendly copper. The alcoholic doctor.
      The spinning coins. "Come in, spinner!"

      You escaped. But part of you wonders if you also missed
      something. Some truth about yourself you weren't ready to face.

      All the little devils are proud of hell.

      The school year begins. The children file in. You pick up
      the chalk and teach them what you know.

      Which isn't much. Not really.

      DISSOLUTION

      The 'Yabba consumed you.

      Whether by your own hand or by slow dissolution into its
      rhythms of drinking and forgetting, you never left.

      Years pass. Decades. You become one of them — another fixture
      at the pub, another face at the two-up ring, another voice
      saying "everyone's bloody friendly in the 'Yabba, mate."

      Somewhere, a bond expires unpaid. A girlfriend moves on.
      A schoolroom gets another teacher.

      You don't remember any of it. You don't remember much of
      anything anymore. Just the heat. The beer. The endless,
      merciless hospitality.

      All the little devils are proud of hell.

      Welcome to the 'Yabba.

      ASSIMILATION

      You never left.

      Not because you couldn't. The trains run. The planes fly.
      But the 'Yabba got inside you, and you found you couldn't
      imagine going back to that other life — the pretending, the
      striving, the endless performance of civilisation.

      You moved into Doc's shack. Took odd jobs. Learned to drink
      without drowning. Found a kind of peace in the simplicity.

      Your bond was paid off eventually — by the government, tired
      of waiting. Robyn married someone else. Your books gathered
      dust in a storage unit in Sydney.

      Sometimes tourists pass through, schoolteachers and office
      workers on their way somewhere else. You shout them drinks.
      Tell them about the 'Yabba.

      "Best little place on earth, mate. Everyone's friendly here."

      They never stay. But you do.

      You always bloody do.
