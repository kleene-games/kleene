      Your hands are slightly clammy as you push through the revolving doors of Sentinel National Bank's headquarters.
      The marble lobby echoes with purposeful footsteps. You're starting today as a Junior Analyst in the Credit Card
      Fraud Analysis team—bottom rung of the corporate ladder, but it's a start.

      At orientation, you meet two people who will shape your journey:

      Sarah Martinez, a veteran Senior Analyst with 15 years at the bank, gives you a warm smile. "Stick with me,
      kid. I'll show you how things really work around here."

      David Chen, a smooth-talking Associate Manager, shakes your hand firmly. "Smart people rise fast here.
      Let me know if you want to skip the grunt work and make real moves."

      Your manager, Patricia Reynolds, barely looks up from her screen during your introduction. "Desk is over there.
      Don't bother me unless it's urgent."

      Friday afternoon. You've spotted something odd in the transaction data—a pattern that might indicate organized
      fraud, but it's outside your assigned accounts. Reporting it means extra work and possibly stepping on toes.

      Sarah notices you studying the data. "Found something?"

      Monday morning, you're called into a meeting with James Whitmore, the VP. He's reviewing your report
      with interest. "We've been looking for someone with initiative in Risk Management. How would you feel

      who really makes decisions, and how to make your accomplishments visible to the right people.

      "Analytics is fine," he says over drinks, "but this bank runs on relationships and perception. Watch."

      He introduces you to Marcus Webb, the SVP of Commercial Banking, at a company mixer. Within minutes,
      Chen has positioned you as "the sharpest analyst in Fraud Detection" despite your minimal experience.

      Webb seems intrigued. "We're expanding the Commercial Lending team. Someone who understands fraud risk
      could be valuable..."

      But you've noticed Chen often takes credit for other people's work. And Sarah has started avoiding you.

      "The bank will try to rush you into management," she warns. "But master the fundamentals first.
      Technical expertise is power they can't take away."

      Under her guidance, you've become genuinely skilled. Your fraud detection rate is the highest in the
      department. Patricia has thawed considerably and now trusts you with complex cases.

      One evening, Sarah shares something troubling: "I've found irregularities in some Commercial Lending
      accounts. Large loans approved despite risk flags. I think someone's overriding the system."

      She looks at you seriously. "This could be big. Want to help me investigate quietly?"

      then Associate Director. The work is challenging but rewarding—you're implementing new fraud detection
      systems, working with C-suite executives, making real impact.

      Your salary has climbed to $145,000. You're 28 years old and managing a team of five analysts.

      Then Whitmore calls you into his office with an unusual request. "I need someone I trust to review the
      Commercial Lending portfolio. Quietly. The numbers don't match the risk profiles."

      As you dig into the data, you realize why: someone has been systematically approving high-risk loans
      that should never have passed review. The exposure is over $50 million.

      But here's the problem—one of the loan officers involved is Marcus Webb's nephew. Webb is on the
      Executive Committee and notoriously protective of family.

      Then the scandal breaks: The Commercial Banking division is under federal investigation for fraudulent
      loan approvals. Several executives are implicated, including Marcus Webb and David Chen.

      You flee to a country without extradition. You live off your hidden money for a few years, but
      eventually it runs out. You can't work legally. Can't return home.

      You end up teaching English in Southeast Asia for $1,500/month, always looking over your shoulder,
      always wondering if today's the day Interpol catches up.

      At 50, you're arrested during a routine traffic stop. Extradited. Convicted. The judge adds fleeing
      to your sentence: 22 years.

      You destroyed everything.

      **Final Position:** Federal Prisoner (Extradited Fugitive)
      **Final Salary:** $0
      **Reputation:** 0/100
      **Ethics:** -10/100
      **Assessment:** Catastrophic failure. Fled justice. Caught anyway.

      You retire at 62 as Director of Fraud Prevention. Salary: $168,000. Pension secured. 401(k) healthy.

      You never took risks. Never made enemies. Never reached the executive level, but you also never
      faced scandal, termination, or prosecution.

      You had a solid, stable, forgettable career. Some days you wonder what might have been. Most days
      you're grateful you avoided the drama.

      **Final Position:** Director of Fraud Prevention (Retired)
      **Final Salary:** $168,000
      **Reputation:** 70/100
      **Ethics:** 60/100

      You retire at 60 as SVP of Fraud Operations. Salary: $305,000. Comfortable but unfulfilled.

      You climbed high enough to be well-paid but never high enough to make real decisions. You mastered
      office politics but sacrificed integrity along the way.

      In quiet moments, you remember Sarah Martinez's investigation—the moment you chose comfort over courage.
      You made good money, but you'll never know what you could have become.

      **Final Position:** SVP of Fraud Operations (Retired)
      **Final Salary:** $305,000
      **Reputation:** 50/100
      **Ethics:** 20/100

      mentor dozens of risk professionals who go on to lead other institutions.

      could have been CEO, but you chose to be something rarer: indispensable in the role you were born for.

      teaching at a business school.

      After the scandal, you rebuild your career on integrity. As Chief Risk Officer at Commonwealth,
      you're known as someone who will never compromise.

      You eventually transition to regulatory work, joining the Federal Reserve as a senior examiner. The
      pay is lower—$225,000—but the impact is profound. You help write new banking regulations that prevent
      the kind of fraud you exposed.

      redeemed by decades of principled work.

      As a federal banking regulator and prominent reform advocate, you spend 20 years fighting for
      financial system integrity. The pay is modest—topping out at $215,000—but your influence is enormous.

      You testify before Congress 14 times. You write two books on banking ethics. Three major reforms
      bear your fingerprints.

      You'll never be wealthy, but your Wikipedia page is three times longer than most bank CEOs. You
      traded wealth for legacy, and history will remember you as someone who mattered.

      You destroyed the corrupt executives who tried to scapegoat you, but you destroyed your own career
      in the process. You spend 15 years in corporate compliance consulting, never earning more than $140,000.

      You were right. They were wrong. But being right didn't save your career.

      At 55, you semi-retire, having accumulated $800,000—enough to live on, but far below what you could
      have earned. Some nights you wonder if mutual destruction was worth it.

      Most nights, you decide it was.

      **Final Salary:** $120,000
      **Reputation:** 30/100
      **Ethics:** 60/100
